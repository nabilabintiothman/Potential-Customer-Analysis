<h1>Capstone project - Identify potential customer for targeted marketing based on purchase behaviour using supervised machine learning</h1>

Customer is the most critical aspect of every business and developing marketing strategies to bring in new customers as well as building long-term relationship with existing customers is a common problem for every business. Through analysing existing customers' data such as their purchase preferences, one can gain many insights that could save marketing cost and time.

This project involves analysing customer's data to identify whether the existing customer is a potential customer or not in order to optimise advertising for a new product that is launch by company A. Our target variable will be the Potential_Customer column, where 1 is potential customer and 0 is non-potential customer. Only customers classified as 1 will receive advertisements and promotional discount code for the new product.

The analysis comprised of four main stages; understanding of the data, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification of customers by building supervised machine learning model such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVC and then evaluating them to find the best model for the dataset.

The code is in the Capstone_potential_customer.ipynb notebook and the dataset which is in the same directory as the notebook is the data.csv file.
